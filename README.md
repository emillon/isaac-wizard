R U a Wizard? - The Binding of Isaac : Rebirth : Augmented
----------------------------------------------------------

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth ("TBoI:R") is a great game, but there are a lot of
items to know. The usual solution to this problem is to have the wiki always
open, but this ruins the experience a bit. Instead, this projects aims at
creating an "augmented" experience on top of the game.

Put simply, it creates an overlay above the game to identify objects and their
effects. Computer Vision is hard and I am by no means an expert, so this does
not work well.

See! It's not even a purple heart.
